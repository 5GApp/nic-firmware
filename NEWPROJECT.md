## Description

The purpose of this repository is to create a basic framework for
spinning up new NFP-based projects.  It mainly contributes build
infrastructure and default component configuration for common components
required for most projects such as flowenv, GRO, BLM, and NFD.  To
create a new project, one should simply copy this directory and rename
it and then fill in one's own appropriate verbage into the README.md
file.
